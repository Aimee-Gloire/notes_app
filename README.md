## Notes on Firebase Usage

- **Authentication:** Users are authenticated using email and password.
- **Firestore:** Each user's notes are stored under:

```plaintext
users/{userId}/notes/{noteId}
```

- Each note document contains:

```json
{
  "content": "Your note text here"
}
```

---

## State Management Explained

- We use **Provider** to manage both **authentication state** and **notes state**.
- Providers call **services** that interact with Firebase.
- This ensures the UI is reactive and always reflects the latest data without manual refreshes.
